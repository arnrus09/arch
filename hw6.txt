1.	power
2.	to determine when a desired byte has been
	produced and it is time to stop shifting
3.	shared memory can be adressed by any processor
	but with distributed memory, each processer
	has its own section of memory that other processers
	must request to use.
4.	they allow a greater amount of memory to be adressed
	then could normally be done with the word size whose
	maximum value was unable to  adress much of memory.
5.	find out how big of chunks were read into the cache
	of a processor at one time and break the array into
	pieces divisible by that size.
6.	decreases the stack pointer by four, increasing the 
	stack size.
7.	
8.	the synchronized key word gives an object's lock to
	a single process, requiring all other processes to wait
	before calling any of that object's other synchronized
	methods.
9.	cache coherence has to do with whether or not a given
	processor's cache is consitent with memory.
