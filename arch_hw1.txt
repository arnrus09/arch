1.	Microcontrollers are ultra lightweight computers.
	Many features of a normal computer are excluded
	because microcontrollers often have a more narrow
	purpose.

3.	Floating point unit, they also have much less memory.

4.	It is a Harvard architecture and not a Von Neumann
	architecture because programs are seperated from
	memory.
5.	RAM is easiy rewrittable and is not persistant.
	ROM is difficult if at all possible to change but
	it is persistant.
6.	Because SRAM requires 6-10 times as many transistors.
7.	FLASH for storing programs, SRAM for short term memory
	storage, and EEPROM for long term memory storage.
8.	A watchdog timer is an interupt that causes a reset
	under certain circumstances.
9.	Memory mapped IO means that reading and writing is
	adressed to locations in memory that communicate 
	directly with the IO pins.
10.	It would use a time delay in a loop, turning it on, delaying,
	turning it off.
11.	It would need to have another state that performed this
	action.
12.	Erasable Programable Read Only Memory, electrically 
	Erasable Programable Read Only Memory.
13.	Universal asynchronous receiver and trasmitter
14.	A signal to change the flow of execution, in the Atmel AVR,
	they are caused by external circumstances.
