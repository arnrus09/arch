1.	8
2.	BL is the lower byte of BX, which is a two byte register.
3.	a: 00000, b: ABCD0
4.	INT, INTO, IRET
5.	SCASW
6.	the first is interpretted as 2 bytes and the second is
	interpretted as one byte.  They both have the same effect
	on memory
7.	it would have to use the whole ax register for each character.
8.	MV identifier PTR [location], value
9.	Maybe because of the fact that a carry flag must be set if
	the first byte overflows so that one may be added 
	to the sum the higher bytes.
